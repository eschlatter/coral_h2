## Fluorescence
```{r}
load('C:/Users/eschlatter/Dropbox/coral_h2/analysis/data/fluor.RData')

fluor_summ <- count(fluor,sire,dam,rep) %>%
  mutate(rep=str_sub(rep,-1))  %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=rep,values_from=n,values_fn=list) %>%
  rename(n_rep1 = '1', n_rep2 = '2') %>%

  dplyr::select(!'NA')
#for each pair of parents, (usually) two replicates. A few have only one replicate: CP, AQY, and CZ
#within each replicate, some number (from 3 to 24) of full-sibs. Sometimes two sets of full-sibs because of clones.

#do the replicates represent similarity across parents? (i.e., should there be any similarity among two unrelated larvae that are both from rep 1?) I think not, right? (That's why the rep column in the original dataset includes parental IDs.)

```


```{r}
hist(fluor$red_rel)
ggplot(fluor, aes(x=sire,y=red_rel,color=dam))+
  stat_boxplot()
red_aov=aov(red_rel~sire, data=fluor)
summary(red_aov)
#TukeyHSD(red_aov)

cols <- c("sire","dam","rep")
fluor %>% 
   group_by(across(all_of(cols))) %>% 
   summarize(x=count(red_rel))

hist(fluor$blue_rel)
ggplot(fluor, aes(x=sire,y=blue_rel,color=dam))+
  stat_boxplot()
blue_aov=aov(blue_rel~sire, data=fluor)
summary(blue_aov)


hist(fluor$green_rel)
ggplot(fluor, aes(x=sire,y=green_rel,color=dam))+
  stat_boxplot()

## Settlement

```{r}
load('C:/Users/eschlatter/Dropbox/coral_h2/analysis/data/settlement.RData')

settlement_summ <- count(settlement,dam,sire,rep,timepoint) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=timepoint,values_from=n) %>%
  rename(n_time24 = '24', n_time48 = '48')
#at each time (24 and 48), six samples per pair of parents
#where a sample is a bunch of larvae, some of whom have settled
#three samples from each rep
```

## Lipids

```{r}
load('C:/Users/eschlatter/Dropbox/coral_h2/analysis/data/lipids.RData')

lipid_summ <- lipids %>%
  mutate(sample=str_sub(sample,-1))  %>%
  rename(rep=sample) %>%
  dplyr::select(-timepoint,-egg,-lipid) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=rep,values_from=loss,values_fn = list) %>%
  rename(loss_rep1 = '1', loss_rep2 = '2')

#two samples per pair of parents (4 for the clones)
#each sample has a lipids value and an egg value; we can calculate loss as (lipid-egg)/egg
#that's probably not enough replication for the animal model to make any sense out of it.
```

## Protein

```{r}
load('C:/Users/eschlatter/Dropbox/coral_h2/analysis/data/protein.RData')

protein_summ <- protein %>%
  dplyr::select(-culture,-egg,-day5) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=rep,values_from=loss,values_fn = list) %>%
  rename(loss_rep1 = '1', loss_rep2 = '2')

#4 samples per pair of parents (8 for the clones)
#each sample has a lipids value and an egg value; we can calculate loss as (lipid-egg)/egg
#for a given set of parents, are samples within a rep expected to be more similar than samples across reps? Probably. If so, we should include both rep and a within-rep identifier as predictor variables. Call the within-rep identifier "id", and add it now.

protein <- mutate(protein,id=as.character(1:nrow(protein)))
